## Architecture

### UI Components (`ui/`)
- **main_window.py**: Contains the main application window with all UI logic
- **plugin_card.py**: Individual plugin card widget for displaying plugin information
- **themes.py**: Design tokens and theme definitions (light/dark mode)
- **loading_overlay.py**: Loading screen overlay for better UX

### API Layer (`api/`)
- **github.py**: GitHub API integration for fetching plugins and patches

### Workers (`workers/`)
- **download_worker.py**: Background thread for downloading and installing plugins

### Services (`services/`)
- **device_detection.py**: Cross-platform KOReader device detection
- **plugin_installer.py**: Plugin installation and management logic
- **cache.py**: Local caching service for offline functionality

### Utils (`utils/`)
- **markdown.py**: Markdown to HTML conversion for README display
- **versioning.py**: Version comparison utilities

## Configuration

- **Cache Duration**: 4 weeks (configurable in `services/cache.py`)
- **GitHub Token**: Optional but recommended for higher API rate limits
- **Log File**: `koreader_store.log` in the application directory

## Development

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **UI Layer**: Pure presentation logic
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and data management
3. **API Layer**: External integrations
4. **Worker Layer**: Background operations
5. **Utils Layer**: Reusable utilities
